## Intro

<div id = "solution">
**For this assignment we were given a data set containing on time and delay information of 2 airlines.**
**We were tasked with tidying, transforming, and analyzing the data.**
**My solution is documented below**
</div>


## Load Libraries

```{r load-libraries}
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
library("tidyverse")
```


## My CSV

<div id  = "solution">
Below is an image of the CSV file I created from the table in the assignment document.
</div>

## Load CSV

```{r load-data}
raw_data <- read.csv("data/data.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
print(raw_data)
```

## Tidy Data

<div id ="solution">
**Use the `gather` function to have the city as rows, set have their respective flights as a `counts` column.**
</div>

```{r }
raw_data = gather(raw_data, "city", "count", 3:7)
print(raw_data)
```

<div id ="solution">
Use the `spread` function to create `ontime` and `delayed` columns. This is makes it easier to visualize the data.
</div>

```{r }
raw_data = spread(raw_data, "performance", "count")
print(raw_data)
```

## Analysis:  Which Airline Performed Better?

<div id = "solution">
  **To find out, lets answer the following questions?**
</div>

- What are their respective market shares?
  
<div id = "solution">
```{r}
total_flights =  sum(raw_data$`on time`) + sum(raw_data$`delayed`)
mutate(raw_data, flights = delayed + `on time`) %>%
  group_by(airline) %>% 
    summarise(airline_total=(sum(flights)/total_flights))
```

**AM WEST has an advantageous 65.7% market share when compared to ALASKA at only 34.3%.**
</div>

- Do the market shares differ across cities?

<div id = "solution">
**This may be better shown by a plot.**

```{r}
      ggplot(data = mutate( raw_data, flights = delayed + `on time`) %>% 
               group_by(city,airline) %>% 
               summarise(airline_total=(sum(flights))), 
             aes(x = city, y = airline_total,fill=airline)) + 
                geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
                coord_flip() +  
                labs(title = "Airlines Market Share by City")
     
```

**The plot shows that AM WEST has a larger market share in 3 of the 5 cities and it dominates in Phoenix. ALASKA dominates in Seattle but at a significantly lower magnitude than AM WEST's domination in Phoenix.**
</div>

- What is each airline overall on time ratio?

<div id = "Solution">
```{r}
  select(raw_data, -city) %>%
  group_by(airline) %>%
    summarise(`on time rate`=( sum(`on time`)/( sum(`on time`) + sum(`delayed`) ) ) )
```

**AM WEST has a higher on time rate of 89.1% when compared to ALASKA at 86.7%**
</div>


- Would you consider choosing an airline based on your destination?

<div id = solution>
**To answer this, lets compare the on time performance of airlines by city.**

**Firstly, lets do a visual.**

```{r}
 data =  select(raw_data,everything()) %>%
  group_by(airline,city) %>%
    summarise(`on time`=( sum(`on time`)/( sum(`on time`) + sum(`delayed`) ) ) ) %>%
    arrange(city)

ggplot(data = data, aes(x = city, y = `on time`,fill=airline)) + 
                geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
                coord_flip() +  
                labs(title = "Airlines Market Share by City")
```

**Strangely it seems the ALASKA performs better, we need to look at the data to be sure.**

```{r}
print(spread(data,city,`on time`))
```

**This is interesting! Alaska has a higher on time rate in every city, despite AM WEST having a higher overall on time rate! ALASKA's on time rate advantage in San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle ranges from 5.9% to 11.8%, a significant advantage. AM WEST's severely dominant market share in Phoenix skewed their overall on time rate and it misled us to believe that they are better.**

**The data suggests that ALASKA is the better airline (based on on-time rates), despite having a lower market share. This highlights the importance of exploratory data analysis, it reveals insights that are not obvious by simply skimming through the data!**
</div>
